# Sip
A quick Gulp starting point for any web project (uses Sass for CSS).

### Getting Started
Download or clone into your project, `cd` into project dir and run `npm init`, followed by `npm install`. You will likely want to add or remove NPM modules on a per-project basis. This is just a general starting point.

### Project Structure
I currently have my dev files in the _src/_ directory. When compiled by Gulp, the CSS gets output into a _style.css_ file in the root directory and the JS gets output to the _script.js_ file in a _js/_ directory. Again, this can be adjusted as you see fit for your preference.
 
NOTE: At the moment, this structure is set up for WordPress theme development. I am currently working on separating different types of projects on their own branches and possibily building a small scaffolding generator for these different types.
